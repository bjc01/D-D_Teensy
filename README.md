# D-D_Teensy
DIY Electronic Musical Instrument

Controller PCB - connects 8 potentiometers to a Teensy 3.2 / 3.2 / 4.0 with audio shield to realise a version of the Drone & Drama instrument.


Notes
v4
potentiometers rotate in conventional direction. clockwise = increase value
distance between pots and teensy increased for more ergonomic user experience (added finger space)
